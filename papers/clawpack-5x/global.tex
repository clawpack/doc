\subsection{Global Changes}
Substantial redesign of the \clawpack code base was performed in the move
from \clawpack 4.x to 5.x.  A summary of these changes (and changes within
the 5.x line) can be found at \url{http://www.clawpack.org/clawpack5.html}.
Major changes that affected all aspects of the code include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Interface to the Riemann solvers were changed so that the same Fortran
Riemann solvers can be used for all versions of the code (including \pyclaw
thanks to \texttt{f2py}).  These have all be collected into the new
\texttt{riemann} repository and calling sequences were modified.  Calling
sequences for a number of other Fortran subroutines were also modified based
on experiences with the \clawpack 4.x code.  These can also be used as a 
stand-alone product for those who only want the Riemann solvers.
    \item Python front-ends were redesigned for specifying run-time options for the flow solver (\texttt{setrun.py} and visualization \texttt{setplot.py}.  The Fortran variants
(\classic, \amrclaw, and \geoclaw) all use a Python script to facilitate
setting input variables.  This is creates text files with a rigidly specified format that are
then read in when the Fortran code is run.  The interface now allows updates to the input parameters while maintaining backwards compatibility.
    \item Reordering indices.  In \clawpack 4.x, the $m$th component of a
system of equations in grid cell $(i,j)$ (in two dimensions, for example),
was stored in \texttt{q(i,j,m)}.  This index order caused problems in
optimizing code and when interfacing with PETSc in PyClaw, and so a global
change was made to change the ordering so that the component number comes
first, e.g. \texttt{q(m,i,j)}.  A seemingly minor change like this affects a
huge number of lines in the code and cannot easily be automated. The use of
version control and regression tests was crucial in the successful
completion of the project.
\end{itemize}
