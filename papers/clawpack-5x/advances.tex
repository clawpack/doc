\section{Advances} \label{sec:advances}

This section describes the major changes in each of the code repositories
in moving from \clawpack 4.x to the most recent version 5.3.
A number of the repositories have seen only minor changes as the bulk of the
development is focused on current research interests.  There are a number of
minor changes not listed here and the interested reader is encouraged to refer
to the change logs\footnote{\url{http://www.clawpack.org/changes.html}} and the
individual \clawpack Git repositories for a more complete list.
