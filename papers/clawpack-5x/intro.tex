\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

The \clawpack software suite \cite{clawpack} is designed for the
solution of nonlinear conservation laws, balance laws, and other
first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations not necessarily
in conservation form.  The underlying solvers are based on the wave
propagation algorithms described by LeVeque in \cite{rjl:fvmhp}, and
are designed for logically Cartesian uniform or mapped grids or an
adaptive hierarchy of such grids.  The original \clawpack was first
released as a software package in 1994 and since then has made major
strides in both capability and interface. More recently a major
refactoring of the code and a move to GitHub for development has
resulted in the release of \clawpack 5.0 in January, 2014. A
significant number of additional improvements have been made since
then.

Because scientific software  has become central to many advances made
in science, engineering, resource management, natural hazards modeling
and other fields, it is increasingly important to describe and
document changes made to widely used packages.  Such documentation efforts
serve to orient new and existing users to the  strategies
taken by developers of the software, place the software package in the context
of other packages, document major code changes, and provide a
concrete, citable reference for users of the software.

With this in mind, the goals of this paper are to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Summarize the development history of \clawpack,
\item Summarize some of the major changes made between the early \clawpack
4.x versions and the most recent version, \clawpack 5.3,
\item Summarize the development model we have adopted, for
managing open source scientific software
projects with many contributors,
\item Identify how users can contribute to the \clawpack suite of tools, and
\item Provide a citable reference for \clawpack 5.x that includes
substantial contributors to this code as authors.
\end{itemize}
By submitting this paper to a refereed journal, we aim to help elevate the role of
producing software in academic departments and to emphasize the
importance of acknowledging the substantial contributions
made by the many developers (some of whom are listed here as authors) to the
\clawpack code.

To meet these aims, this paper provides a brief history of \clawpack in
\cref{sub:history}, a background of the mathematical concerns in \cref{sec:hyp},
the modern development approach now being used in \cref{sec:development},
the major feature additions in the \clawpack 5.x major release up until Version 5.3 in
\cref{sec:advances}. Some concluding thoughts and future plans for
\clawpack are mentioned in
\cref{sec:conclusions}.

\subsection{History of \clawpack} \label{sub:history}

The first version of \clawpack was released by LeVeque in 1994
\cite{clawpack-v1} and consisted of Fortran code for solving problems on a
single, uniform Cartesian
grid in one or two space dimensions, together with some Matlab
\cite{MATLAB:2015a} scripts
for plotting solutions. The wave-propagation method implemented
in this code provided a general way to apply recently developed
high-resolution shock capturing methods to general hyperbolic systems and
required only that the user provide a ``Riemann solver'' to specify a new
hyperbolic problem.
Collaboration with Berger \cite{mjb-rjl:amrclaw}
soon led to the incorporation of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in two space
dimensions, and work with Langseth \cite{jol-rjl:3d, jol:thesis}
led to three-dimensional versions of the wave-propagation algorithm and the
software, with three-dimensional AMR then added by Berger.

Version 4.3 of \clawpack contained a number of other improvements to
the code and formed the basis for the examples presented in a textbook
\cite{rjl:fvmhp} published in 2003.  That text not only provided a
complete description of the wave propagation algorithm, developed by LeVeque,
but also is notable in that the codes used to produce virtually all of figures
in the text were made available online \cite{rjl:fvmhp}.  These examples are
available at \url{http://depts.washington.edu/clawpack/clawpack-4.3/book.html}.

In 2009, \clawpack Version 4.4 was released with a major change from Matlab
to Python as the recommended visualization tool, and the development
of a Python user interface for specifying the input data.

Since then, a number of other features were added to handle new
applications, to provide a better user interface and visualization tools, and to
incorporate higher-order accurate algorithms, MPI and OpenMP parallelization, and
other enhancements. The \clawpack 4.x line of code ended with Version 4.6.3
(released in January 2013) with many of the changes from 4.3 to 4.6 summarized at
\url{http://depts.washington.edu/clawpack/users-4.6/changes.html}.

Version 5 of \clawpack introduces a number of modern approaches to
code development, interfacing with other codes, and adding new
capabilities. These changes are the subject of the rest of the paper.

\subsection{Hyperbolic problems}\label{sec:hyp}

In one space dimension, the hyperbolic systems solved with
\clawpack typically take the form of conservation laws
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hyp1a}
q_t(x,t) + f(q(x,t))_x = 0
\end{equation}
or non-conservative linear systems
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hyp1b}
q_t(x,t) + A(x) q(x,t)_x = 0,
\end{equation}
where subscripts denote partial derivatives and $q(x,t)$ is a vector with
$m\ge 1$ components.  The coefficient matrix $A$ in \cref{eq:hyp1b} or
the Jacobian matrix $f'(q)$ in \cref{eq:hyp1a} is assumed to be
diagonalizable with real eigenvalues for all relevant values of
$q$, $x$, and $t$.  This condition guarantees that the system is hyperbolic,
with solutions that are wave-like.  The eigenvectors of the system
determine the relation between the different components
of system, or waves, and the eigenvalues determine the speeds at which these
waves travel.  The right hand side of these equations could be
replaced by a ``source term'' $\psi(q,x,t)$ to give a non-homogeneous
equation that is sometimes called a ``balance law'' rather than a
conservation law.  Spatially-varying flux functions $f(q,x)$ in
\cref{eq:hyp1a} can also be handled using the f-wave approach
\cite{db-rjl-sm-jr:vcflux}.

Examples of equations solved by \clawpack include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  Advection equation for one or more tracers.  The velocity field is
typically prescribed from wind data, or as the solution to another fluid
flow problem.  Typical applications include transport of heat, energy,
pollution, smoke or another species that do not influence the velocity field.

    \item The Euler equations of compressible, inviscid fluid dynamics.
        They consist of conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy.
        The wave speeds depend on the local fluid velocity
        and the acoustic wave velocity (sound speed).  Source terms can be added
        to include the effect of gravity, viscosity or heat transfer.
        These systems have important applications in
        aerodynamics, climate and weather modeling, and astrophysics.
    \item The shallow water equations, describing the velocity and
        surface height of a liquid whose depth is small relative to
        typical wavelengths.  In this case source terms may include
        the effect of varying bathymetry and of bottom friction.
        These equations are used, for instance, to model inundation
        caused tsunamis and dam breaks, as well as atmospheric flows.
    \item Elastic wave equations, used to model waves in solid
    materials.
\end{itemize}
%For a one-dimensional problem \cref{eq:hyp1a} or \cref{eq:hyp1b},
%the {\em Riemann problem} consists of the equation together with
%piecewise constant initial data with a single jump discontinuity.

Discontinuities (shock waves) can arise in the solution of nonlinear
hyperbolic equations, causing difficulties for traditional numerical
methods based on discretizing derivatives directly.  Modern shock
capturing methods are often based on solutions to the {\em Riemann
problem} that consists of equations \cref{eq:hyp1a} or
\cref{eq:hyp1b} together with piecewise constant initial data with a
single jump discontinuity.  The solution to the Riemann problem is a
similarity solution (a function of $x/t$ only), typically consisting
of $m$ waves (for a system of $m$ equations) propagating at constant
speed.  This is true even for nonlinear problems, where the waves may
be shocks or rarefaction waves (through which the
solution varies continuously in a self-similar manner).

The main theoretical and numerical difficulties of hyperbolic problems
involve the prescription of physically correct weak solutions and
understanding the behavior of the solution at discontinuities.  The
Riemann solver is an algorithm that encodes the specifics of the
hyperbolic system to be solved, and it is the only routine (other than
problem-specific setup such as initial conditions) 
that needs to be changed in order to apply the
code to different hyperbolic systems.  In some cases, the Riemann
solver may also be designed to enforce physical properties like
positivity (e.g., for the water depth in \geoclaw) or to account for
forces (like that of gravity) that may be balanced by flux terms.

\clawpack is based on Godunov-type finite volume methods in which
the solution is represented by cell averages.  Riemann problems
between the cell averages in neighboring states are used as the
fundamental building block of the algorithm.
The wave-propagation algorithm originally
implemented in \clawpack (and still used in much of the code) is based on
using the waves resulting from each Riemann solution together with limiter
functions to achieve second-order accuracy where the solution is smooth
together with sharp resolution of discontinuities without spurious numerical
oscillations (see \cite{rjl:fvmhp} for a detailed description of the
algorithms).   The recently developed SharpClaw algorithms (see
\cref{sec:pyclaw}), now incorporated in \pyclaw, use higher-order WENO methods
but rely on the same Riemann solvers.

Problem-specific boundary conditions must also be imposed, which
are implemented by a subroutine that sets the solution value in
{\em ghost cells} exterior to the domain each time step.  The
\clawpack software contains library routines that implement several
sets of boundary conditions that are commonly used, {\em e.g.}
periodic boundary conditions, reflecting solid wall boundary
conditions for problems such as acoustics, Euler, or shallow water
equations, and non-reflecting (absorbing) extrapolation boundary
conditions.  As with all \clawpack library routines, the boundary
condition routine can be copied and modified by the user to implement
other boundary conditions needed for a particular application.

In two space dimensions, hyperbolic equations might take the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hyp2a}
q_t(x,y,t) + f(q(x,y,t))_x + g(q(x,y,t))_y = 0
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hyp2b}
q_t(x,y,t) + A(x,y)q(x,y,t)_x + B(x,y)q(x,y,t)_y = 0
\end{equation}
In order to be hyperbolic, the coefficient matrices $A$ and $B$ in \cref{eq:hyp2a}
or the Jacobian matrices $f'(q)$ and $g'(q)$ in \cref{eq:hyp2b}
must have the property that any linear
combination gives a diagonalizable matrix with real eigenvalues.  The
extension to three space dimensions is similar.

In two or three space dimensions, the wave-propagation methods
are extended using either dimensional splitting, so that only
one-dimensional Riemann solvers are needed, or by a multi-dimensional
algorithm based on {\em transverse Riemann solvers} introduced in
\cite{rjl:wpalg}.  Both approaches are supported in \clawpack.
A variety of Riemann solvers have been developed for \clawpack, many
of which are collected in the \texttt{riemann} repository, see
\cref{sec:riemann}.

Adaptive mesh refinement is essential for many problems and has been
available in two space dimensions since 1995, when Marsha Berger
joined the project team and her AMR code for the Euler equations of
compressible flow was generalized to fit into the software which
became \amrclaw \cite{Berger:1998ia}.  \amrclaw was carried over to
three space dimensions using the unsplit algorithms introduced in
\cite{jol-rjl:3d}.  Starting in Version 5.3.0, dimensional splitting
is also supported in \amrclaw, which can be particularly useful in
three space dimensions where the unsplit algorithms are much more
expensive.  Other recent improvements to \amrclaw are discussed in
\cref{sec:amrclaw}.
