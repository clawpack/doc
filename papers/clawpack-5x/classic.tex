\subsection{\classic}
The \texttt{classic} repository contains code implementing the wave
propagation algorithm on a single uniform grid, in much the same form as the
original \clawpack 1.0 version of 1994 but with various enhancements added
through the years.  Some major changes introduced in \clawpack 5.x:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The three-dimensional wave propagation algorithm first described
in \cite{jol:thesis, jol-rjl:3d} 
and first implemented in \clawpack 3.0 in 1997, remained in place through
\clawpack 4.3.  The 3D codes 
disappeared from \clawpack 4.4 --- the Python user interface and plotting
routines were introduced at that time in 1D and 2D, but were not 
carried over to three dimensions.  In \clawpack 5.0, the three-dimensional
code was reincorporated.  Moreover, OpenMP directives were added to the 3D code
for greater efficiency on shared memory computers.
