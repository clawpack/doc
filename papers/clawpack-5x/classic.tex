\subsection{\classic}
The \texttt{classic} repository contains code implementing the wave
propagation algorithm on a single uniform grid, in much the same form as the
original \clawpack 1.0 version of 1994 but with various enhancements added
through the years.  Following the introduction of \clawpack 4.4 the
three-dimensional routines were left out of the Python user interfaces and
plotting routines.  These have been reintroduced in \clawpack 5.  Additionally
the OpenMP shared-memory parallelism capabilities have been extended to the
three-dimensional code.
