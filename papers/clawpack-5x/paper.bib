abstract = {The shallow water equations are a commonly accepted governing system for tsunami prop- agation and inundation. In their most generally valid form, the equations are a set of hyperbolic integral conservation laws{\textemdash}a general class of systems for which an extensive body of numerical theory exists. In this thesis, finite volume wave propagation methods{\textemdash} high resolution Godunov-type methods{\textemdash}are extended to this form of the shallow water equations in the context of tsunami modeling. A novel approximate Riemann solver is developed in order to handle the diverse flow regimes exhibited by tsunamis. This solver provides well-balanced source term inclusion required for accurate resolution of near steady state solutions{\textemdash}a necessity when modeling transoceanic tsunami propagation. The solver also preserves nonnegative water depths and accurately captures discontinuities and moving shorelines, making it appropriate for inundation modeling. Adaptive refinement algorithms are extended to this application. These algorithms allow evolving sub-grids of various resolu- tions to move with features in the solution. Extending the adaptive algorithms to tsunami modeling requires some new interpolation and integrating strategies in order to preserve steady states. Finally, the methods are extended to solution on a sphere or idealized earth- fitted reference ellipsoids. Together, the methods developed allow modeling transoceanic tsunami propagation as well as coastal inundation in single global-scale simulations.},

abstract = {We present a new hybrid paradigm for parallel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) that combines the scalability and lightweight architecture of tree-based AMR with the computational efficiency of patch-based solvers for hyperbolic conservation laws. The key idea is to interpret each leaf of the AMR hierarchy as one uniform compute patch in Rd with md degrees of freedom, where m is customarily between 8 and 32. Thus, computation on each patch can be optimized for speed, while we inherit the flexibility of adaptive meshes. In our work we choose to integrate with the p4est AMR library since it allows us to compose the mesh from multiple mapped octrees and enables the cubed sphere and other nontrivial multiblock geometries. We describe aspects of the parallel implementation and close with scalings for both MPI-only and OpenMP/MPI hybrid runs, where the largest MPI run executes on 16,384 CPU cores.},

This allows its use on a variety of new problems, including hyperbolic equations not in conservation form, problems with source terms or capacity functions, and logically rectangular curvilinear grids. This framework requires a modified approach to maintaining consistency and conservation at grid interfaces, which is described in detail. The algorithm is implemented in the AMRCLAW package, which is freely available.},

abstract = {We present a class of augmented approximate Riemann solvers for the shallow water equations in the presence of a variable bottom surface. These belong to the class of simple approximate solvers that use a set of propagating jump discontinuities, or waves, to approximate the true Riemann solution. Typically, a simple solver for a system of m conservation laws uses m such discontinuities. We present a four wave solver for use with the the shallow water equations-a system of two equations in one dimension. The solver is based on a decomposition of an augmented solution vector-the depth, momentum as well as momentum flux and bottom surface. By decomposing these four variables into four waves the solver is endowed with several desirable properties simultaneously. This solver is well-balanced: it maintains a large class of steady states by the use of a properly defined steady state wave-a stationary jump discontinuity in the Riemann solution that acts as a source term. The form of this wave is introduced and described in detail. The solver also maintains depth non-negativity and extends naturally to Riemann problems with an initial dry state. These are important properties for applications with steady states and inundation, such as tsunami and flood modeling. Implementing the solver with LeVe-que's wave propagation algorithm [R.J. LeVeque, Wave propagation algorithms for multi-dimensional hyperbolic systems, J. Comput. Phys. 131 (1997) 327-335] is also described. Several numerical simulations are shown, including a test problem for tsunami modeling. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Numerical modeling of transoceanic tsunami propagation together with the detailed modeling of inundation of small-scale coastal regions poses a number of algorithmic challenges. The depth-averaged shallow water equations can be used to reduce this to a time-dependent problem in two space dimensions, but even so it is crucial to use adaptive mesh refinement in order to efficiently handle the vast differences in spatial scales. This must be done in a {\textquotedblleft}well- balanced{\textquotedblright} manner that accurately captures very small perturbations to the steady state of the ocean at rest. Inundation can be modeled by allowing cells to dynamically change from dry to wet, but this must also be done carefully near refinement boundaries. We discuss these issues in the context of Riemann-solver based finite volume methods for tsunami modeling. Several examples are presented using the GeoClaw software and sample codes are available to accompany the paper. The techniques discussed also apply to a variety of other geophysical flows.},

  abstract = {This report builds on and supercedes Phase I of a demonstration
Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment
(PTHA) study of Crescent City, California {[}23], which developed an improved
methodology for PTHA and
associated products that addressed only tsunami flooding depth.
The study documented in this report was originally conceived as a follow-on
that simply extended Phase I
products to include additional tsunami parameters associated with tsunami
flow in particular, current speed
and momentum flux. As this study was underway, however, it was reviewed by
the California Probabilistic
Tsunami Hazard Analysis Work Group (CA PTHA WG) {[}25] that included experts
on various PTHA issues,
most notably the critical issue of seismic source specification.
Subsequently, the CA PTHA WG review
concluded that the CSZ sources used in the Phase I work was not adequately
consistent with the 2014
Update to the National Seismic Hazard Maps (NSHM) {[}54]. Consequently, an
improved suite of CSZ sources
had to be developed that was more consistent with the NSHM, as discussed in
Section 7.6. As a consequence,
the entire set of inundation model simulations had to be repeated and new
PTHA flow depth products were
developed. The results presented here thus supercede the results presented in
the Phase I report {[}23].
Both Phase I {[}23] and this study were funded by BakerAECOM and motivated by
FEMA's desire to
explore methods to improve products of the FEMA Risk Mapping, Assessment, and
Planning (Risk MAP)
Program. Here we briefly summarize the goals, deliverables, technical
challenges, additional work, primary
results and conclusions, and recommendations of this study.},
