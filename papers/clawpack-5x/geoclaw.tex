\subsection{\geoclaw}

The \geoclaw branch of \clawpack was developed to solve the
two-dimensional shallow water equations over topography
for modeling tsunami generation, propagation, and inundation.
The \amrclaw code formed the starting point but it was necessary to make many
modifications to support the requirements of this application, as described
briefly below.  This code originated with the work of George
\cite{dgeorge:masters, dgeorge:phd, dgeorge:jcp}
and was initially called
{\sc TsunamiClaw}.  Later it became clear that many other
geophysical flow applications have similar requirements and the code was
generalized as \geoclaw.


One of the major issues is the treatment of wetting and
drying of grid cells at the margins of the flow. The handling of dry
states in a Riemann solver is difficult to handle robustly, and has gone
through several iterations.
\geoclaw must also be well-balanced in order to preserve steady states, in
particular the ``ocean at rest''.
To achieve this, the source terms in the momentum equations arising from
variations in topography are incorporated into the Riemann solver rather than
using a fractional step splitting approach. This is critical for modeling
waves that have very small amplitudes relative to the variations in the depth
of the ocean.  
See \cite{rjl:wbfwave10} for a general discussion of such methods and 
\cite{dgeorge:phd, dgeorge:jcp} for details of the Riemann solver used in
\geoclaw.  Other features of
\geoclaw include the ability to solve the equations in latitude--longitude
coordinates on the surface of the sphere, and the incorporation of source terms
modeling bottom friction using a Manning formulation. More details about the
code and tsunami modeling applications can be found in
\cite{BergerGeorgeLeVequeMandli:awr11, LeVequeGeorgeBerger:an11}. In 2011, a
significant effort took place to verify and validate \geoclaw against the US
National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) benchmarks
\cite{GonzalezLeVequeEtAl2011}.
NTHMP approval of the code allows \geoclaw to be used in hazard mapping
projects that are funded by this program or other federal and state agencies,
e.g.
\cite{GonzalezLeVequeEtAl2013a,GonzalezLeVequeEtAl2014}.
One such project is illustrated in \cref{fig:ocosta}.

In addition to a variety of tsunami modeling applications,
\geoclaw has been used to solve dam break problems in steep terrain
\cite{George:Malpasset}, storm surge problems \cite{Mandli:ws} (see \cref
{fig:surge}),
and submarine landslides \cite{jhkim:phd}.  The code also
formed the basis for solving the
multi-layer shallow water equations for storm surge modeling
\cite{mandli:phd, Mandli:2013it},
and is currently being extended further to handle debris flow modeling in the
packages D-Claw
\cite{Iverson:2014dc,George:2014gh} (see \cref{fig:meager}).

Nearly one quarter of the files in the \amrclaw source library have to be
modified for \geoclaw. There are currently 113 files in the \amrclaw 2D
library, of which 26 are
replaced by a \geoclaw-specific files of the same name
in the \geoclaw 2D library. For example, to preserve a flat sea surface when
interpolating, it is necessary to interpolate the surface elevation
(topography plus water depth) rather than simply interpolating the depth
component of the solution vector as would normally be done in \amrclaw.
An additional 24 files in the \geoclaw shallow water equations
library handle other complications introduced by the need to model tsunamis
and storm surge.

Several other substantial improvements in the
algorithms implemented in \geoclaw have been made between versions 4.6 and
5.3.0, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item In depth-averaged flow, the wave speed and therefore the CFL
condition depends on the depth.  As a result, flows in shallow water
that have been refined spatially may not need to be refined in time.
This ``variable-time-stepping'' was easily added along with the anisotropic
capabilities that were added to \amrclaw.
\item The ability to specify topography via a set of {\tt
topo} files that may cover overlapping regions at different resolutions has been added.
 The finite volume method requires cell averages of topography, computed by
integrating a piecewise bilinear function constructed from the input {\tt
topo} files over each grid cell.  In \clawpack 5.1.0, this was improved to
allow an arbitrary number of nested {\tt topo} grids.
When adaptive mesh refinement is used,
regridding may take place every few time steps.  Improvements were made
in 5.2.0 so that topography could be copied rather than always being
recomputed in regions where there is an existing old grid.

\item The user can now provide multiple  {\tt dtopo} files that
specify changes to the
initial topography at a series of times.  This is used to specify sea-floor
motion during a tsunamigenic earthquake, but can also be used to specify
submarine landslide motion or a failing dam, for example.
%Major changes were
%made to these algorithms in 5.1.0 to fix a problem in earlier versions that
%resulted in incorrect topography motion in some cases, also resulting in a much
%more robust handling of multiple  {\tt dtopo} files.

\item A number of new Python modules has been developed to assist the user
in working with {\tt topo} and {\tt dtopo} files.  These are documented in
the \clawpack documentation and several of them are illustrated with Jupyter
notebooks found in the \clawpack Gallery.

\item New capabilities were added in 5.0.0 to monitor the maximum of
various flow quantities over a specified time range of a simulation.
This capability is crucial for many applications where the maximum
flow depth at each point, maximum current velocities in a harbor, or
maximum momentum flux (a measure of the hydrodynamic force that would
be exerted by the flow on a structure) is desired.  Arrival time of
the first wave at each point can also be monitored.  Such
capabilities were included in the 4.x version of the code, but were
more limited and did not always perform properly near the edges of
refinement patches.  In Version 5.2 these routines were further
improved and extended.  The user can specify a grid of points on which
to monitor values, and the new code is more flexible in allowing
one-dimensional grids (e.g. a transect), two-dimensional rectangular
grids, or an arbitrary set of points\footnote{Described in
