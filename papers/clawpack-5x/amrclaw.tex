\subsection{\amrclaw}\label{sec:amrclaw}
Fortran code in the \amrclaw repository performs block structured adaptive mesh
refinement \cite{BO,BC} for both
\clawpack and \geoclaw  applications.
A short overview is given
here to set the stage for a description of recent changes.
\amrclaw includes the functionality for:
\begin{itemize}
\item
coordinating the flagging of points where refinement is needed,
with a variety of criteria possible for flagging cells that need refinement
from each level to the next finer level (including Richardson extrapolation,
gradient testing, or user-specified criteria).  See
\url{http://www.clawpack.org/flag.html};
\item
organizing the flagged points into efficient grid
patches at the next finer level, using the algorithm of
\cite{mjb-rig:cluster};
\item interpolating the solution to newly created fine grids and initializing auxiliary data (topography, wind velocity, metric data and so on) on  these grids,
\item averaging fine grid solutions to coarser grids,
\item orchestrating the adaptive time stepping (i.e. subcycling in time),
\item interpolating coarse grid solution to fine grid ghost cells
\item maintaining conservation at patch boundaries between resolution levels.
\end{itemize}
The algorithms implemented in \amrclaw have been discussed in detail in
\cite{mjb-rjl:amrclaw,LeVequeGeorgeBerger:an11}.

\amrclaw now allows users to specify ``regions'' in space-time
$[x_1,x_2] \times [y_1,y_2] \times [t_1,t_2]$ in which refinement is forced to
be at least at some level $L_1$ and is allowed to be at most $L_2$.  This can be
useful for constraining refinement, e.g. allowing or ensuring resolution of only a small coastal region in a global tsunami simulation.
Previously the user could enforce such conditions by writing a custom
flagging routine, but now this is handled in a general manner so that the
parameters above \comment{(above where?)} can all be specified in \texttt{setrun.py}.  Multiple
regions can be specified, and a simple rule is used to determine the
constraints at a grid cell that lies in multiple regions. See \comment{cite website?}
\url{http://www.clawpack.org/flag.html#refinement-regions}

Auxiliary arrays are often used in \clawpack to store data that
describes the problem and the routine.
The routine \texttt{setaux} must then be provided by the user to set these values each time a
new grid patch is created.  For some applications computing these values can be time-consuming.  In \clawpack 5.2,
this code was improved to allow reuse of values from previous patches at
the same level where possible at each regridding time.
This is backward compatible, since no harm is done if previously
written routines are used that still compute and overwrite instead of
checking a mask.

In \clawpack 5.3 the capability to specify spatially varying boundary
conditions was added. For a single grid, it is a simple matter to
compute the location of the ghost cells that extend outside the
computational domain and set them appropriately.  With AMR however,
the boundary condition routine can be called for a grid located
anywhere in the domain, and may contain fewer or larger numbers of
ghost cells. The boundary condition routines must be written in a
rather unusual way that does not assume it is always setting the same
number of ghost cells, or that the same number of reflected cells
inside the domain always exist.  \comment{This isn't clear.
Presumably, the boundary condition routines are only used for physical
boundaries, and the boundaries that are interior to the domain would
just ``pass through'' the physical boundary routine, right?
Shouldn't, then, xlower, ylower, dx,dy, etc be enough to set spatially
varying physical boundary conditions?}

Anisotropic refinement is allowed in both two and three dimensions.
This means that the spatial and temporal refinement ratios can be
specified independently from one another (as long as the temporal
refinement satisfies the CFL condition).  In addition, capabilities
have been added to automatically select the refinement ratio on each
level based on the CFL condition. \comment{What does this mean?}

\amrclaw has also been
parallelized using OpenMP directives based on grid patch-based decomposition.
The main paradigm in structured AMR is a loop over all patches at a level, where
some operation is done on each patch (i.e. taking a time step, finding ghost
cells, conservation updates, etc.).  This lends itself easily to a {\tt parallel
for} loop construct where each iteration of the loop corresponds to a grid at
that level. Dynamic scheduling is used with a chunk size of one, so that one
thread is assigned one patch at a time. To help with load balancing, patches at
each level are sorted from largest to smallest workload when they are first
created, using the total number of cells in the grid as an indicator of work.
Note that this approach causes a memory bulge. Each thread must have its own
scratch arrays to save the incoming and outgoing waves and fluxes for future
conservation fix-ups. The bulge is directly proportional to the number of
threads executing. For stack-based memory allocation per thread, the use of the
environment variable {\tt OMP\_STACKSIZE} to increase the limit may be
necessary.

The parallelization of \amrclaw and \geoclaw assumes multi-core machines for the
target architecture.  \pyclaw, on the other hand, does not include AMR but uses
MPI via PETSc to achieve parallelism on distributed memory machines that scale
to tens of thousands of cores (see \cref{sec:pyclaw}). Other frameworks exist,
most notably \forestclaw \cite{Burstedde:we} which are being developed in
parallel with \amrclaw to provide scalable AMR calculations on large distributed
memory machines. \todo{Need to cite \cref{fig:figure1} and add caption.}

The 3D \amrclaw code has been reintroduced in 5.0.
