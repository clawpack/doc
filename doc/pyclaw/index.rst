Pyclaw 
======

Installation::

    pip install clawpack

To run an example, launch an IPython session and then::

    from clawpack.pyclaw import examples
    claw = examples.shock_bubble_interaction.setup()
    claw.run()
    claw.plot()

**Features:**

    * A **hyperbolic PDE solver** in 1D, 2D, and 3D, including mapped grids and surfaces, built on Clawpack;
    * **Massively parallel** -- the same simple script that runs on your laptop will
      scale efficiently on the world's biggest supercomputers (see :ref:`parallel`);
    * **High order accurate**, with WENO reconstruction and Runge-Kutta time integration
      (see :ref:`solvers`);
    * Simple and intuitive thanks to its Python interface.

PyClaw makes use of the additional Clawpack packages, 
`Riemann <http://github.com/clawpack/riemann>`_ and
`VisClaw <http://github.com/clawpack/visclaw>`_ for Riemann solvers and visualization, 
respectively.

If you have any issues or need help using PyClaw, `contact us <claw-users@googlegroups.com>`_.

Riemann Solvers reference documentation
========================================
The Riemann solvers now comprise a separate package.  For convenience,
documentation of the available pure python Riemann solvers is included
here.  Many other Fortran-based Riemann solvers are available.
