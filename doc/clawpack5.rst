================================
Changes in Clawpack 5.0
================================

Clawpack 5.0 is a major reorganization of the Clawpack code base that has
been going on for several years.  

PyClaw in 5.0
-------------

The extensive PyClaw code base is now incorporated into Clawpack.  See
:ref:`clawpack_packages` for more about how PyClaw relates to the other 
:ref:`clawpack_components`.  For recent changes in PyClaw, see the
`PyClaw changelog <https://github.com/clawpack/pyclaw/blob/master/CHANGES.md>`_.

Fortran package changes
-----------------------

The rest of this page concerns the Fortran components of Clawpack.

There is no complete list of changes since it has evolved to be very
different from the 4.x version of Clawpack in organization, but some of
major changes that affect users are listed below.

Some tools are available to assist users in converting code from earlier
versions.  To go from Clawpack 4.6 to 5.0, see
:ref:`claw46to50`.   Some older Clawpack 4.3 code can be first converted 
to 4.6 form using :ref:`claw43to46`.

If you wish to view recent changes on GitHub,
note that Clawpack is an *organization*, meaning that it is
comprised of several repositories.  Go to the 
`Clawpack GitHub <https://github.com/clawpack>`_ 
webpage to view all the repositories.  Major changes that are specific
to PyClaw since its initial release in 2012 are listed in the
`PyClaw changelog <https://github.com/clawpack/pyclaw/blob/master/CHANGES.md>`_.

You might also view the 
`issues <https://github.com/orgs/clawpack/dashboard/issues>`_
associated with each Clawpack repository on
GitHub to see what bugs and features we are working on.

**Some of the major changes:**

* In all of the Clawpack codes, indices of the primary arrays `q` (for
  the solution) and `aux` (for auxiliary variables) have been reordered for
  better cache performance and to interface better with the PETSc code (used
  in as an option in PyClaw).  For example, in the two-dimensional Clawpack
  4.x code, `q(i,j,m)` denoted the m'th component of the solution vector in
  the `(i,j)` grid cell.  With this convention the various components of the
  solution in a single grid cell are scattered in memory with a stride of
  `mx*my`.  
  In Clawpack 5.0, the indexing for the same value is `q(m,i,j)` so that
  the components of `q` in a single grid cell are continguous in memory.

  Note that this means user routines such as `qinit.f`, `setaux.f`,
  and Riemann solvers must be modified.

* The calling sequence of Riemann solvers has been modified by adding
  `maux` (the number of auxiliary variables) as another parameter.
  This is required because of the reordering of indices so that
  `aux(ma,i,j)` is now the `ma` element of the `aux` vector in the `(i,j)`
  cell.  The leading dimension of `aux` is assumed to be `maux` and is
  required in declaring this variable.  

* Calling sequences of many subroutines have changed, so users converting
  code from Clawpack 4.x should carefully compare the calling sequences in 
  any custom Fortran code to those in relevant examples, or to the default
  versions in the libraries.

* Many Riemann solvers for different applications are now found in the 
  `riemann repository <https://github.com/clawpack/riemann>`_.
  In the future major changes may be made to the form of the Riemann solvers
  to allow more flexibility.

* The names of many input variables in `setrun.py` have been changed to
  clean things up and be more systematic.  Several options that used to be
  specified by obscure means have been clarified, and some new options have been
  added.  For details and documentation on the new parameters, see:
  
   * :ref:`setrun_changes` 
   * :ref:`setrun`
   * :ref:`setrun_amrclaw`
   * :ref:`setrun_geoclaw`
  
* The directory structure has been reorganized.  See
  :ref:`clawpack_components`.  

* Some regression tests have been added to the `classic`, `amrclaw`,
  and `geoclaw` directories in subdirectories named `tests`.
  `Travis <https://travis-ci.org/>`_ is now used for continuous integration 
  testing during development.

* The 3d single-grid and AMRClaw code, missing since Version 4.3, 
  has been updated to conform with  1d and 2d style.  In particular,
  the inputs can now be specified using `setrun.py`.

* Three-dimensional plotting routines in Python are still under
  construction, so currently there is no capability to use `setplot.py`
  to specify the desired plots or `make plots` to produce them.  However,
  the Matlab plotting routines have been updated and are now found in
  Visclaw.  See :ref:`matlabplots`.  It is also possible to render 3d
  plots using the VisIt GUI, see :ref:`visit_plotting`.

* The classic single-grid Clawpack code (without AMR) is now in the
  `classic` directory and the `classic repository
  <https://github.com/clawpack/classic>`_ on GitHub.  Some new
  capabilities have been added, e.g.:

  * OpenMP parallelization has been added to the 3d codes.  
    See :ref:`openmp`.
    

* The AMRClaw code is now in the 
  `amrclaw repository <https://github.com/clawpack/amrclaw>`_.
  Some new capabilities have been added, e.g.:   
  
  * It is now possible to specify refinement *regions*, previously only
    supported in GeoClaw.  For a description, see :ref:`refinement_regions`.

* The GeoClaw code is now in the
  `geoclaw repository <https://github.com/clawpack/geoclaw>`_.
  Some new capabilities have been added, e.g.:

  * There is an improved set of tools for monitoring the maximum depth or
    surface elevation seen over a fixed grid, and the first arrival times.
    See :ref:`fgmax`.
 
  


.. _setrun_changes:

Changes to input parameters in setrun.py from 4.x to 5.0
----------------------------------------------------------

Changes to general parameters 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Many names have been changed, e.g.

  * `ndim` to `num_dim`
  * `xlower`, `ylower`, `zlower` are now `lower[0], lower[1], lower[2]`.
  * `xupper`, `yupper`, `zupper` are now `upper[0], upper[1], upper[2]`.
  * `mx, my, mz` are now `num_cells[0:3]`.

  There are many other such changes.  It is best to take a look at the 
  `setrun.py` for an example in `$CLAW/classic/examples`.  

See also:
  
 * :ref:`setrun`
 * :ref:`claw46to50`

Changes to AMR parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The `rundata` object generally defined in `setrun.py` now has an 
  attribute `rundata.amrdata` and AMR parameters are attributes of this
  object.   Most names of attributes have changed from those used in 4.x.

* Setting `mxnest` negative to indicate that anisotropic refinement
  in different directions might be used has been eliminated.
  Now this is always assumed and one must always specify 
  refinement ratios in each direction and in time.

* New attributes have been added to indicate whether Richardson
  extrapolation and/or the routine ins `flag2refine` should be used
  to flag cells for refinement.  See :ref:`refinement`.

* The capability of using "regions" to specify areas where refinement is
  forced or prohibited has been extended from GeoClaw to AMRClaw.
  See :ref:`refinement_regions`.

 * :ref:`setrun_amrclaw`
 * :ref:`claw46to50`


Changes to GeoClaw parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A number of changes have been made to parameter names and also functionality
in some cases.

See also:
  
 * :ref:`setrun_geoclaw`
 * :ref:`claw46to50`


Changes to plotting routines
-----------------------------

The plotting routines are now in Visclaw, see :ref:`plotting`.

The Matlab tools from version 4.x have been updated a bit and many examples
once again include `.m` files for users who wish to plot using Matlab.

The Python routines have also been updated.  For the most part older
versions of `setplot.py` should still work, with a few exceptions:

 * In AMR the individual grids are now called "patches" rather than "grids".  
   This caused a few changes in attribute names in :ref:`ClawPlotItem`:
   
    * The old `plot_type` named `2d_grid` has been renamed `2d_patch`
    * The old attirbute `gridlines_show` has been renamed `celledges_show`
    * The old attirbute `grideges_show` has been renamed `patchedges_show`

To use the interactive plotting tool `Iplotclaw`, you now need to import
this via::

    from clawpack.visclaw.Iplotclaw import Iplotclaw

See :ref:`plotting_python` for more information.
