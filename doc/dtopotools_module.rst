dtopotools module for moving topography
=======================================

**This describes new tools added in Clawpack 5.2.1.**

:ref:`geoclaw/dtopotools_examples.ipynb` illustrates how to use some of the tools.

See also :ref:`geoclaw/Okada.ipynb`,
which illustrates the Okada model using some of these tools.

The file `$CLAW/geoclaw/tests/test_dtopotools.py` contains some tests of these
tools.  Looking at these test routines may also give some ideas on 
how to use them.
