***************************************
Plotting using Matlab
***************************************

Up through Version 4.3, Matlab was always used for plotting and an
extensive set of plotting tools have been developed.  These are still
available in `$CLAW/visclaw/src/matlab`
These are essentially unchanged from 4.3.
Some newer documentation can be found at
??

Starting in 4.4, we have also introduced a set of Python plotting tools, see
:ref:`plotting` for some of the advantages of switching to these tools.


.. warning:: There is one change to the form of the output files `fort.000N` starting in
   Clawpack 4.4:  The parameter `ndim` has been added.
