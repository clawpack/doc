Doxygen documentation of AMRClaw
================================

Under Development!

We are currently adding documentation to the Fortran files in AMRClaw so that
documentation can be generated using `Doxygen
<http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`_

The resulting documentation pages give a description of the parameters and
also will show call graphs to help understand what other subroutines call a
subroutine or are called by it.  For an example, see
`filpatch.f90 <http://www.clawpack.org/doxygen/amrclaw/2d/filpatch_8f90.html>`_.

See `the file list <http://www.clawpack.org/doxygen/amrclaw/2d/files.html>`_ for
a list of the AMRClaw files.
