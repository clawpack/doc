Riemann
=======

All Clawpack packages make use of the same collection of Riemann solvers.

See also the new book `Riemann Problems and Jupyter Solutions
<https://bookstore.siam.org/fa16/bonus>`_ (SIAM, 2020),
which consists of a set of Jupyter notebooks illustrating
the basic concepts of Riemann problems and approximate solvers.
