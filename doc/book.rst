Examples from the book FVMHP
############################



The book 
`Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems <http://www.clawpack.org/book.html>`_  
contains many examples that link to Clawpack codes used to create the
figures in the book.  These codes are  available for Clawpack
4.3 via the 
`book webpage <http://www.clawpack.org/book.html>`_  

Some of have been converted to Clawpack 5.0 form, with a `setrun.py`
file for setting run time data and a `setplot.py` file for specifying plots
with Python.  See:

 * :ref:`setrun`
 * :ref:`setplot`

Available examples 
------------------

The examples converted so far can be found in the 
directory `apps/fvmbook` if you clone the `apps` repository.
(See :ref:`apps`.)

You can also browse the examples in the
