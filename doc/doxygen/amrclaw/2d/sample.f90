!!  the patch can also be described by the corners (xlp,ybp) by (xrp,ytp).
!!  vals are needed at time t, and level level,
!!
!!  first fill with  values obtainable from the level level
!!  grids. if any left unfilled, then enlarge remaining rectangle of
!!  unfilled values by 1 (for later linear interp), and recusively
!!  obtain the remaining values from  coarser levels.
!! \param self  Initialized instance on exit.
!! \param mygrid  BLACS descriptor
!! \param desc  Descriptor of the distributed matrix.
!! \param rowcol  "C" for column, "R" for row blocks.
