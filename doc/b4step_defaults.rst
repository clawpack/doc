========================
b4step default routines
========================

For GeoClaw, see :ref:`b4step_geoclaw`.

Below are the default `b4step` library routines for Classic and AMRClaw.  
By default these do nothing.  If you wish to specify `aux` arrays you will
need to copy one of these files to your application directory and modify it
as needed.  Remember to change to `Makefile` to point to the proper version.

.. _b4step_geoclaw:

b4step routine in GeoClaw
--------------------------

In GeoClaw, there is a library routine that sets `aux(1,i,j)` to the cell
average of the bathymetry, `aux(2,i,j)` to the ratio of the true cell area
to `dx*dy` (the capacity function), and `aux(3,i,j)` to the length ratio of 
the bottom edge to `dx` (The latter two quantities vary  
with latitude when `coordinate_system == 2`).
