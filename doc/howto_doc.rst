Guide for updating this documentation
=============================================

The restructured text files are in the `clawpac/doc
<https://github.com/clawpack/doc>`_ repository in `$CLAW/doc/doc`.

To create html files::

    cd $CLAW/doc/doc
    make html

To view the files, point your browser to `$CLAW/doc/doc/_build/html/index.html`

If you like what you see, you can push back to your fork and then issue a
pull request to have these changes incorporated into the documentation.


Updating the webpages
---------------------

A few developers can push html files to the repository
`clawpack/clawpack.github.com
<https://github.com/clawpack/clawpack.github.com>`_ 
which causes them to show up on the web at
`http://clawpack.github.io/doc/index.html
<http://clawpack.github.io/doc/index.html>`_.  

To do so, first create the html files as described above in
`$CLAW/doc/doc/_build/html`.  Commit any changed source files and 
push to `clawpack/doc <https://github.com/clawpack/doc>`_.

Then do::

    cd $CLAW/clawpack.github.com
    git checkout master
    git pull origin  # make sure you are up to date before doing next steps!

    cd $CLAW/doc/doc
    source rsync_clawpack.github.sh     

This copies the contents of `$CLAW/doc/doc/_build/html` to 
`$CLAW/clawpack.github.com/doc`

Then move to the latter repository and
add and commit any new or changed files (all files are needed, so "git add
." should work).  For the commit message you might want to add the commit
hash of the most recent commit in $CLAW/doc/doc::

    cd $CLAW/clawpack.github.com/doc
    git add . 
    git commit -m "changes from doc/doc commit <hash>"

And finally push to the web::

    git push origin

which assumes that `origin` is
`git@github.com:clawpack/clawpack.github.com.git`.

It may take a few minutes for the updated webpages to appear at 
`<http://clawpack.github.io/doc/index.html>`_.
