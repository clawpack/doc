.. This (-*- rst -*-) format file contains commonly used link targets
   and name substitutions.  It may be included in many files,
   therefore it should only contain link targets and name
   substitutions.  Try grepping for "^\.\. _" to find plausible
   candidates for this list.

.. NOTE: reST targets are
   __not_case_sensitive__, so only one target definition is needed for
   nipy, NIPY, Nipy, etc...
