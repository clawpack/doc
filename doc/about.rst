About this software
===================

Clawpack stands for "Conservation Laws Package" and was initially developed
for linear and nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, with a
focus on implementing high-resolution Godunov type methods using limiters in
a general framework applicable to many applications.  These finite volume
methods require a "Riemann solver" to resolve the jump discontinuity at the
interface between two grid cells into waves propagating into the neighboring
cells.

Adaptive mesh refinement is included, see :ref:`amrclaw`.

Recent extensions allow the solution of hyperbolic problems that are not in
conservation form.  We are actively working on extensions to parabolic
equations as well.

The "wave propagation" algorithms implemented in Clawpack are discribed in
detail in the book `Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems
<http://www.amath.washington.edu/~claw/book.html>`_
Virtually all of the figures in this book were generated using Clawpack and
the source code for each can be found in 
`$CLAW/book <claw/book>`_
See :ref:`book` for a list of available examples with pointers to the codes
and resulting plots.

See the :ref:`biblio` for some pointers to papers describing Clawpack and
the algorithms used in more detail.

.. warning:: Need to update!

Many people have contributed to the development of Clawpack since its
inception in 1994.  

Major contributions have been made by the following individuals:

 * Randall J. LeVeque, University of Washington [RJL]

   Originally developed the 1d and 2d Clawpack routines and is the lead
   developer. 

 * Jan Olav Langseth, Norwegian Defence Research Establishment [JOL]

   Developed the 3d algorithms and software with RJL.

 * Marsha Berger, Courant Institute, NYU  [MJB]

   Wrote much of the 2d AMR software originally for the Euler equations and
   worked with RJL to generalize to the AMRCLAW framework.  Later adapted
   this to 3d in work with David McQueen (NYU) and DAC, and continues to be 
   involved in further development of the software.

 * Donna Calhoun, CEA, Paris [DAC]

   Improved Matlab graphics routines and extended to 3d.  Developed 3d AMR
   routines and applications.  Developed ChomboClaw, an extension to allow
   the Clawpack Riemann solvers and frontend to be used together with
   the Chombo AMR package developed by Phil Colella's group at LBL.

 * Sorin Mitran, UNC

   Developed MPI and HDF routines and the Clawpack 4.3 website.  He is also
   the author of BEARCLAW and ASTROBEAR software implementing AMR in a similar
   framework to Clawpack.

 * Peter Blossey, UW

   Developed MPI and HDF versions in Clawpack 4.3.

 * David George, USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory [DLG]

   Developing GeoClaw (with RJL, MJB, KM) for geophysical depth-averaged
   applications.

 * Kyle Mandli, UW

   Main developer of the PyClaw pure python version in directory
   `$CLAW/python/pyclaw <claw/python/pyclaw>`_,
   and the Python/Fortran interface. 

 * Chris Swierczewski, UW

   Working on the Python interface, Sage interface, installation routines.

 * David Ketcheson, KAUST

   Developing SharpClaw for high order methods, e.g. WENO, with Runge-Kutta 
   time stepping.

Numerous students and other users have contributed towards this software, by
finding bugs, suggesting improvements, and exploring its use on new
applications.  Thank you!
