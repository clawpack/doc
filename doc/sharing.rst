Saving and sharing results
##########################


Clawpack now includes some tools to help facilitate archiving and sharing
results that you have obtained with this software.  
These make it relatively easy to generate
a set of webpages such as those seen when browsing the examples collected in
:ref:`galleries`.

These webpages can easily be posted on your own website to be viewed by
others if you wish, for example to share on-going work with collaborators or
to supplement a journal article.


Making webpages of plots
========================

The "make .plots" option available via the standard Makefiles will create a
set of webpages illustrating the plots and allowing easy navigation between
frames.  These webpages also allow viewing all frames of a plot as an
animation (via javascript within the browser).  

See :ref:`plotting` for more details on how to specify what plots will
appear on these webpages.

Sharing your results
====================

To make it easy for others to view your code and the resulting plots, you
can simply copy the example directory (containing the code 
and the _plots subdirectory)  to your publicly visible web pages.
