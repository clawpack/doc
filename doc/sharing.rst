Saving and sharing results
##########################

.. warning:: Out of date!  Needs updating.


Clawpack now includes some tools to help facilitate archiving and sharing
results that you have obtained with this software.  
These make it relatively easy to generate
a set of webpages such as those seen when browsing the examples listed at
:ref:`apps` or :ref:`book`.

These webpages can easily be posted on your own website to be viewed by
others if you wish, for example to share on-going work with collaborators or
to supplement a journal article.

Making html files from codes and README files
=============================================

In a directory with a standard Clawpack Makefile the command::

   $ make .htmls

will create html files from all the .f, .py, .data files in this directory
and will also convert README.txt into README.html.   This uses the python
script `$CLAW/doc/clawcode2html.py <claw/doc/clawcode2html.py>`_
to convert each file.  

This script is based on a more general script 
`mathcode2html <http://www.amath.washington.edu/~rjl/mathcode2html/>`_ and
the documentation of that contains some examples of formating.  



Making webpages of plots
========================

The "make .plots" option available via the standard Makefiles will create a
set of webpages illustrating the plots and allowing easy navigation between
frames.  These webpages also allow viewing all frames of a plot as an
animation (via javascript within the browser).  For example see

   * `$CLAW/apps/advection/2d/example1/_plots/_PlotIndex.html
     <claw/apps/advection/2d/example1/_plots/_PlotIndex.html>`_

See :ref:`plotting` for more details on how to specify what plots will
appear on these webpages.

Sharing your results
====================

To make it easy for others to view your code and the resulting plots, you
can simply copy the example directory (containg the code, the .html files,
and the _plots subdirectory)  to your publicly visible web pages.
