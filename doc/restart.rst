.. _restart_checkpt:

Checkpointing a computation
---------------------------

In this section `clawdata` refers to the `rundata.clawdata` attribute
of an object of class `ClawRunData`, as is generally set at the top
of a `setrun.py` file.

The `rundata.clawdata.checkpt_style` parameter specified in `setrun.py` (see
:ref:`setrun`) determines how often checkpointing is done, if at all.

See the comments in :ref:`setrun_sample` for examples.

The checkpoint files are saved in the same output directory as the solution
output, with file names of the form `fort.tchkNNNNN` (a small ASCII file) and
`fort.chkNNNNN` (a large binary file)  where `NNNNN` is the
step number on the coarsest level.  These files containt all the information
needed to restart the computation at this point.

.. _restart_restart:

Restarting a computation
-------------------------

To restart a computation from any point where checkpoint files have been saved,
modify `setrun.py` to set::

    clawdata.restart = True
    clawdata.restart_file = 'fort.chkNNNNN' 

where `NNNNN` is the time step number from which the restart should
commence.  

You should also modify the output time parameters to specify that the
computation should go to a later time than the time of the restart file
(which can be found in the file `fort.tchkNNNNN`).

Note the following in setting the new output times:

* The value `clawdata.t0` should generally be left to the original starting
  time of the computation.

* If `clawdata.output_style==1`, then `clawdata.t0` and `clawdata.tfinal`
  along with `clawdata.num_output_times` are used to determine equally
  spaced output times.  Only those times greater than the restart time will
  be used as output times.

  If `clawdata.output_t0==True` then a time frame will be output at the
  restart time (not t0 in general).  This may duplicate the final frame that was
  output from the original computation.  Set `clawdata.output_t0 = False`
  to avoid this.

* If `clawdata.output_style==2`, then `clawdata.output_times` is a list of
  output times and only those times greater than or equal to 
  the restart time will be used as output times.

.. _restart_makefile:

Modifying the Makefile for a restart
------------------------------------

To restart a computation, it is necessary to modify the `Makefile` as well
as `setrun.py`.  In the `Makefile`, set::

    RESTART = True

This will ensure that the original set of output files (for times up to the
restart time) and the checkpoint
file will not be deleted.  They will still be available in the output directory
along with the newly created output files.
