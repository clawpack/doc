Examples from the book FVMHP
############################



The book `Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems
<https://www.clawpack.org/fvmhp_materials/>`_  
contains many examples that link to Clawpack codes used to create the
figures in the book.  These codes were originally developed for Clawpack
4.3 and these versions are still available from 
`this webpage <https://depts.washington.edu/clawpack/clawpack-4.3/book.html>`_,
but they will only run with Clawpack 4.3, which has not been developed since
2006.

Many of the examples have been converted to Clawpack 5.x form, with
a `setrun.py` file for setting run time data and a `setplot.py`
file for specifying plots with Python.  See:

 * :ref:`setrun`
 * :ref:`setplot`

Available examples 
------------------

The examples converted to v5.x form so far can be found in the 
directory `apps/fvmbook` if you clone the `apps` repository.
(See :ref:`apps`.)

You can also browse the examples and plots/animations of the results in the
`Clawpack gallery of fvmbook applications <http://www.clawpack.org/gallery/gallery/gallery_fvmbook.html>`__
