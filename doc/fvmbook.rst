Examples from the book FVMHP
############################



The book 
`Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems
<http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/book.html>`_  
contains many examples that link to Clawpack codes used to create the
figures in the book.  These codes are  available for Clawpack
4.3 via the 
`book webpage <http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/book.html>`_  

Some of have been converted to Clawpack 5.x form, with a `setrun.py`
file for setting run time data and a `setplot.py` file for specifying plots
with Python.  See:

 * :ref:`setrun`
 * :ref:`setplot`

Available examples 
------------------

The examples converted so far can be found in the 
directory `apps/fvmbook` if you clone the `apps` repository.
(See :ref:`apps`.)

You can also browse the examples and plots/animations of the results in the
`Clawpack gallery of fvmbook applications <http://www.clawpack.org/gallery/gallery/gallery_fvmbook.html>`__
