Clawpack components
===================


Clawpack is developed using the `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ version control
system and all the source code is openly available via the
`Clawpack GitHub Organization <https://github.com/organizations/clawpack>`_.

The code is organized in several independent git repositories.  One of these
is the `clawpack/clawpack <https://github.com/clawpack/clawpack>`_
super-repository that is used to coordinate versions between other
repositories.  If you are interested in cloning the code directly from
GitHub and/or helping develop Clawpack, see :ref:`developers`.

If you download a tar file of Clawpack, as described in
:ref:`downloading`, then you will obtain a top level directory that has the
following subdirectories:

* `classic`  (Classic single-grid Fortran code)
* `amrclaw` (:ref:`amrclaw`, AMR version of Fortran code)
* `riemann`  (Riemann solvers, in Fortran, also used by PyClaw)
* `geoclaw`  (GeoClaw for geophysical flows)
* `clawutil`  (Utility functions, Makefile.common used in multiple repositories)
* `pyclaw`  (Python code, some of which is needed also for Fortran version)
* `visclaw`  (Python graphics and visualization tools)

These correspond to individual GitHub repositories.
