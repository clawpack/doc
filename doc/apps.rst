A few examples of how to use different flavors of Clawpack are included in
the directories

* `$CLAW/classic/examples`
* `$CLAW/amrclaw/examples`
* `$CLAW/geoclaw/examples`
* `$CLAW/pyclaw/examples`


These examples demonstrate some of the basic capabilities.
The plots resulting from running these examples should agree with those seen
in the :ref:`galleries`.

More complex examples and applications are archived in the Github
`clawpack/apps` repository found at
`https://github.com/clawpack/apps <https://github.com/clawpack/apps>`_.

In particular, the directory `apps/fvmbook` contains many :ref:`book`.

Users interested in obtaining this collection of applications can either
clone the repository using git::

    git clone git://github.com/clawpack/apps

or navigate to `https://github.com/clawpack/apps <https://github.com/clawpack/apps>`_
and click on the "Download ZIP" button at the bottom of the page.
