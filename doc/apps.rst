A few examples of how to use different flavors of Clawpack are included in
the directories

* `$CLAW/classic/examples`
* `$CLAW/amrclaw/examples`
* `$CLAW/geoclaw/examples`

These examples demonstrate some of the basic capabilities.
The plots resulting from running these examples should agree with those seen
in the :ref:`galleries`.

More complex examples and applications are archived in the Github
`clawpack/apps` repository found at
`https://github.com/clawpack/apps <https://github.com/clawpack/apps>`_.

You can clone this repository or download a zip file from the webpage.

In particular, the directory `apps/fvmbook` contains many :ref:`book`.
