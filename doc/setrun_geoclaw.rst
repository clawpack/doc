*****************************************************************
Specifying GeoClaw parameters in `setrun.py`
*****************************************************************


Since :ref:`geoclaw` is a modified version of :ref:`amrclaw`, 
all of the parameters that
are required for AMRClaw are also needed by GeoClaw.  See
:ref:`setrun_amrclaw` for a discussion of these, and :ref:`setrun` for a
description of `setrun.py` input scripts more generally.

In addition, a number of other parameters should be set in the `setrun.py`
file in any :ref:`geoclaw` application.
See also the :ref:`geohints` for more about parameter choices.

It is best to look at a specific example while reading this section, for
example  :ref:`setrun_geoclaw_sample`.

   Not online yet.
  

The function `setrun` in this module is essentially the same as for AMRClaw,
except that it expects to be called with *claw_pkg = 'geoclaw'*.  This call
should be performed properly by the Makefile if you have *CLAW_PKG =
geoclaw* set properly there.

.. comment

  The section :ref:`setrun_geoclaw_sample_parameters` 

The new section :ref:`setrun_setgeo` 
in this module contains the new GeoClaw parameters.

A brief summary of these:

Refinement factors in time
--------------------------

New in 4.6.0: It is now possible to have GeoClaw automatically choose
refinement factors in time on each level based on an estimate of the maximum
wave speed on all grids at this level.  For most hyperbolic problems the CFL
condition suggests that one should refine in time by the same factor as in
space.  However, for GeoClaw applications where fine grids appear only in
shallow coastal regions this may not be the case.  Automatic choice of
refinement factors is used if

.. attribute:: variable_dt_refinement_ratios : bool

is set to True.  The default is False, in which case refinement factors in time
are specified by the user as usual.

General geo parameters
----------------------

.. attribute:: igravity : integer

   *igravity = 1* should be set in general.

.. attribute:: gravity : float

   gravitational constant in m/s**2, e.g.  *gravity = 9.81*.

.. attribute:: icoordsys : integer

   *icoordsys = 1* for Cartesian x-y in meters, 
   
   *icoordsys = 2* for latitude-longitude on the sphere.

.. attribute:: Rearth : float

   radius of the earth in meters, e.g.  *Rearth = 6367.5e3*.

.. attribute:: icoriolis : integer

   *icoriolis = 1* to include Coriolis terms in momentum equations

   *icoriolis = 0* to omit Coriolis terms (usually fine for tsunami modeling)
   

.. _setrun_tsunami:

Tsunami parameters
------------------

These parameters are used for tsunami modeling (can also be used for other
problems  --- need to clarify this!).


.. attribute:: sealevel : float

   sea level (often *sealevel = 0.*)  
   This is relative to the 0 vertical datum of the topography files used.

.. attribute:: wavetolerance : float

   Cells are flagged for refinement if the difference between the surface
   elevation and sea level is larger than this tolerance.  Note that whether
   refinement is actually done depends also on how various AMR regions have
   been set (see Section :ref:`regions`) and also on several other
   attributes described below that contain information on minimum and
   maximum refinement allowed in various regions.

.. attribute:: maxleveldeep : float

   For simulations over the ocean, it is often useful to specify
   a maximum refinement level allowed in deep parts of the ocean.  This is
   useful if a high level of refinement is specified on some rectangular
   region but only the parts of this region near the shore actually need to
   be refined.

.. attribute:: depthdeep : float

   The deepness that triggers the refinement limitation imposed by
   *maxleveldeep* above.

.. attribute:: ifriction : integer

   .. warning :: **This is not actually used in the code and will be deprecated.**

      If *coeffmanning > 0* then friction terms will be applied, regardless
      of the value of *ifriction*.

.. attribute:: coeffmanning : float

   For friction source terms, the Manning coefficient.
   See :ref:`manning`.

.. attribute:: frictiondepth : float

   Friction source terms are only applied in water shallower than this,
   since they have negligible effect in deeper water.

    - 4 = Perturbation to surface level


.. attribute:: qinitfiles : list of lists

.. _setrun_fixedgrids:

   This can be used to specify a set of grids where output should be
   produced at the specified resolution regardless of how the AMR grids look
