.. note:: Clawpack is an "organization" on GitHub, which means that it is
   comprised of several distinct repositories.  These pages can be used to
   manage any (or all) of the Clawpack repositories, and in this documentation
   the string `REPOS` should be replaced by the specific repository name,
   e.g. *amrclaw*, *pyclaw*, *visclaw*, etc.
