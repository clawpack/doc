 Introduction
==============

These pages describe a git_ and github_ workflow for the Clawpack_
project.

There are several different workflows here, for different ways of
working with *Clawpack*.

This is not a comprehensive git reference, it's just a workflow for our
own project.  It's tailored to the github hosting service. You may well
find better or quicker ways of getting stuff done with git, but these
should get you started.

For general resources for learning git, see :ref:`git-resources`.

.. note:: Clawpack is an "organization" on GitHub, which means that it is
   comprised of several distinct repositories.  These pages can be used to
   manage any (or all) of the Clawpack repositories, and in this documentation
   the string `REPOS` should be replaced by the specific repository name,
   e.g. *amrclaw*, *pyclaw*, *visclaw*, etc.
